Welcome to my portfolio! 👋

This repository showcases my completed projects and academic assignments, all of which have been successfully implemented with functional user interfaces and working systems. Here, you’ll find projects that reflect my skills in programming, system development, and problem-solving.

⚠️ Only finished projects are included—those still in development or incomplete are not shown here.

Explore each project folder to see the code, interface, and results of my work. This portfolio represents my progress and capabilities in software development and practical project implementation.
